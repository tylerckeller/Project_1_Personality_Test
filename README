Notes: In order to verify that the "questions.txt" file was correctly formatted and read questions
in without any issues, I checked both the first and third and fifth characters of each line. If the first char
was a digit (using isdigit()) and the third and fifth characters were alphabetic (using isalpha()),
then the question data was read and loaded. If the data failed to load for any line (excluding the first
and last lines), the loop broke, and the function returned false.
